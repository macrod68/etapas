While current recent pen and paper ethical guidelines are a step forward, in order to support verification and automation of AI Governance, technology solution is necessary. Our solution consists of a transparent metadata layer that logs everything that happens in the disruptive technology development lifecycle into immutable and auditable data stores. The results can then be used in analyses of how disruptive technologies will impact the public sector (capital, labor, knowledge), incl. the benefits and risks associated with implementation.</p>
