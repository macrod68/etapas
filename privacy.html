                <p>The ETAPAS project encourages you to review the privacy statements of the Web Sites you choose to link to from this Web Site, so that you can understand how these Web Sites collect, use and share your information. The ETAPAS project is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web Sites outside of the www.etapasproject.eu domain.</p>
                <h4>How and why will we use your personal data?</h4>
                <p>The personal data collected will only be used:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>To provide you with news and general information about outputs and events generated by the ETAPAS project, if you opt in to receive the ETAPAS project newsletter</li>
                <li>To attend to your enquiries to us if you use the contact form on the website.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What is the legal basis for such processing?</h4>
                <p>We rely on the following as a legal basis for processing your information:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We may rely on the consent that you provide us at the point of data collection or disclosure to us to process such data for the purposes outlined herein. Art. 6(1)(a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for processing operations for which we obtain consent for a specific processing purpose.</li>
                <li><strong>Supply of goods and services:</strong> If the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, as is the case, for example, when processing operations are necessary for the supply of goods or to provide any other service (including enquiries concerning our products or services), the legal basis for the processing is Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures, for example in the case of inquiries concerning our products or services. Is our company subject to a legal obligation by which processing of personal data is required, such as for the fulfillment of tax obligations, the processing is based on Art. 6(1) (c) of the GDPR.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> We may rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, provided that our interests are not overridden by your interests, fundamental rights, or freedoms. In particular, we may process your personal data in reliance on a legitimate interest in the effective delivery of information and services to you. We may have other legitimate interests and, if so, we will make clear what those interests are at the relevant point in time. Article 6(1)(f) serves as the legal basis for processing personal data for the purpose of the legitimate interest pursued by the ETAPAS project or by a third party.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance with legal obligations:</strong> We may process your personal data if necessary for us to comply with a legal obligation arising under an applicable law to which we are subject. The legal basis for the processing in this case is Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To the extent that we process any &ldquo;special&rdquo; or &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; categories of personal data relating to you, we will do so because either: (i) you have given us your explicit consent to carry out such processing; (ii) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or (iii) you have made the data manifestly public.</p>
                <h4>Who and where is your personal data transferred to?</h4>
                <p>Access to your personal data is only granted through User ID/Password to a defined population of users, without prejudice to a possible transmission to the bodies in charge of a monitoring or inspection task in accordance with Union legislation. This data is held in the European Union and stored on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.</p>
                <h4>For how long will we store your personal data?</h4>
                <p>Your Personal Data will be retained only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy We will retain your personal data only for those periods necessary to fulfill the various purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement, unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law and to comply with the rules concerning checks and audits of projects funded by the Horizon 2020 programme.</p>
                <h4>Your rights</h4>
                <p>To ensure fair data processing, you can exercise a number of rights including:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The right to access of personal information that we are processing about you and relevant supplementary information</li>
                <li>The right to rectification and completion of your personal data</li>
                <li>The right to erasure of your personal data</li>
                <li>The right to data portability (ie to ask for your personal information to be provided back to you or transferred to a third party)</li>
                <li>The right to restriction of the processing of your personal data</li>
                <li>The right to object to the processing of your personal data on grounds related to your particular situation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you have a question about this privacy policy or wish to exercise any of the above rights, please contact <a href="mailto:etapas@etapasproject.eu">etapas@etapasproject.eu</a>, explicitly specifying your request.</p>
                <p>If you are unsatisfied with the way in which we have handled your personal data or any privacy query or request that you have raised to us, you have a right to complain to a Supervisory Data Protection Authority.</p>
                <h4>How can we make changes to this privacy policy?</h4>
                <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in response to changing legal, regulatory or operational requirements. We encourage you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how the ETAPAS project is protecting your information.</p>
